    "matplotlib is a 2D Python plotting library that is meant to create _publication quality figures_ in both hardcopy and interactive environments. It is the cornerstone of data visualization in Python and as a result is a fiscally sponsored project of the [NumFocus](http://www.numfocus.org/) organization. matplotlib is: \n",

    "The primary way to interact with matplotlib is through the `pyplot` API, which replaced the more procedural `pylab` API which was intended to emulate MATLAB graphics commands. (**Note:** the `pylab` API is no longer supported and you shouldn't use it). The `pyplot` API is a _simple_ interface to the drawing components provided by matplotlib, as shown in the component architecture below:\n",
